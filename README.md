# STAT 490: Nonparametric Regression With Neural Networks

The goal of this project is to compare the empirical convergence rates of neural network estimators and classical statistical methods in the context of nonparametric regression problems.

## Overview

- `data_generation` implements regression functions and generates simulated data
- `main` performs experiments using `data generation` and `nn_helpers`
- `nn_helpers` neural network implementation
